                    This is a very nice picture of me wearing my favorite hat. The feathers are from a real bird. Some people say that I look a bit sad in this picture but I can assure you it's simply because I bought a corset that was just a tad small. You don't really notice until you start yanking those strings around your ribcage. It was on sale and I was trying to squeeze (see what I did there?) every last dime I received from the insurance payout. Did I not mention the settlement? One of those conniving Parisian "fashion desingers" attempted to rip off the design of my hat. I met him at a PÃ¢tisserie while I purchased one too many bags of profiteroles. Sadly, that was the purchase that knocked me off the wagon and I am now squeezed into my corset like a regular andouille.
